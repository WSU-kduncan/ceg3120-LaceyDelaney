Setup 

- To get an API token, I went into the setting of my bot and copied the token from there. 

- You need to put your token in a .env file with the discord token and server name in that file. 

- Some packages I needed to install were pip, discord.py, python3, and python-dotenv. 


Usage

- I changed some of the variable names and the message. I changed the bots name is spongebot and had it say a spongebob reference. I also changed the quotes in the write up to be sayings from The Office. I then changed the word the would make the bot say certain things.  

- command: apple! 

- This command will prompt the bot to tell you an office saying. 


Research

- https://replit.com/talk/learn/Hosting-discordjs-bots-on-replit-Works-for-both-discordjs-and-Eris/11027

- I think this resource will end up working because it is from a reliable source. UpTimeroBot is a platform where you can copy your server link into the software to have it run for however long it can. It does say since it is through repl it there wil be times when its down for a couple of minutes since replit doesn't run 24/7
